As part of my mission to Yellow Pages, I developed a tool to converts PowerPoint file into html pages. The tool was written in Ruby. I&rsquo;ve got permission to put it into open source so you can also convert your slides to just simply share.

An example of what happens:  
[Pages Jaunes hostting services][1]

Sources of the tool:
